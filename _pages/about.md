Hi! I'm Zhuo (Cecilia) Chen (陈茁). I'm a rising senior at Bryn Mawr College. I major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I will apply to grad school for fall 2026. Here are several projects that I'm currently working on: 
1. Improving the existing spectrum-based fault localization technique by adding edge consideration with Professor [Chris Murphy](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~cmurphy/) in Swarthmore College;
2. Evaluate and enhance the robustness of scientific machine learning with Professor [Ryan Kastner](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/) in UC San Diego mentored by [Olivia Weng](https://www.oliviaweng.com/);
