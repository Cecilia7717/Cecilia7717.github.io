Hi! I'm Zhuo (Cecilia) Chen. I'm a senior at Bryn Mawr College. I double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am looking for PhD position starting from 2026 fall. Here are several projects that I'm currently working on/worked before: 
1. Evaluate and enhance the robustness of scientific machine learning with Professor [Ryan Kastner](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/) in UC San Diego mentored by [Olivia Weng](https://www.oliviaweng.com/);
2. Discover the Hamiltonian Path in a rectangle grid graph with a triangular hole advised by Professor [Dianna Xu](http://mainline.brynmawr.edu/~dxu/) in Bryn Mawr College;
3. Study test oracle generation and bug recognition performance by LLM for real-world bugs with Professor [Elizabeth Dinella](https://elizabethdinella.github.io/) in Bryn Mawr College;
4. Improve the existing spectrum-based fault localization technique by adding edge consideration and using Control Flow Graph with Professor [Chris Murphy](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~cmurphy/) in Columbia University;
5. Design blockchain-based framework for EV charging scheduling advised by Professor [Jie Li](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lijie/) in Shanghai Jiaotong University and mentored by [Xinyu Lu](https://luxinyu.com.cn/) now in CUHK.

If you’re interested in more details about any project, you can find expanded descriptions in the *Project* section. Feel free to email me (z[lastname]4@brynmawr.edu) with any questions.
