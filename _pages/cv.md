Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Pure Math, Bryn Mawr College, expected May 2026  
  GPA: 3.73/4.0  
  Relevant coursework: Computational Geometry, Machine Learning, Analysis of Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Computational Linguistics, Principles of Programming Languages, Information and Coding Theory, Intro to Computer Systems, Intro to Data Structures, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Evolutionary Game Theory

Research Experience
======
* **University of California, San Diego (June 2024 – Current)**  
  *Research Assistant – Robust Scientific Machine Learning*  
  Evaluated robustness of neural networks to different levels of input noise. Collected and visualized data to analyze how loss changes with noise.

* **Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China (May 2024 – July 2024)**  
  *Research Assistant – Blockchain-Based Framework for EV Charging Scheduling*  
  Designed and deployed experiments to implement proposed EV scheduling algorithms. Collected data, created visualizations, and analyzed outcomes.

* **Bryn Mawr College (June 2023 – Current)**  
  *Researcher – Debugging Visualization*  
  Improved accuracy of fault localization techniques by 16.9% using larger datasets and test cases. Compared fault localization approaches through experiments using Java methods from the Apache Commons Math library.
