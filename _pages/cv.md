Education
======
* **B.S. in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics**, Bryn Mawr College  
  Expected May 2026  
  GPA: 3.77/4.0  
  Relevant coursework: Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms for Big Data, Computational Geometry, Software Analysis, Machine Learning, Analysis of Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Computational Linguistics, Principles of Programming Languages, Information & Coding Theory, Intro to Computer Systems, Data Structures, Abstract Algebra I–II, Real Analysis I, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Evolutionary Game Theory  

Research Experience
======
* **Bryn Mawr College (June 2025 – Current)**  
  *Research Assistant – Automated Exceptional Test Oracle Generation*  
  Studied oracle generation for real-world bugs, comparing TOGA, TOGLL, and EditAS2 with emphasis on exceptional bugs. Evaluated state-of-the-art AI models to improve oracle-generation performance.

* **Bryn Mawr College (April 2025 – Current)**  
  *Independent Researcher – Hamilton Paths in Rectangle Grid Graphs with a Triangle Hole*  
  Developed a decomposition method using stacked T-shapes to derive geometric and parity-based constraints for Hamiltonian paths. Proved new impossibility results for grid graphs with triangular holes. (Work in progress)

* **University of California, San Diego (June 2024 – Current)**  
  *Research Assistant – Robust Scientific Machine Learning*  
  Evaluated robustness of neural networks to input noise, weight perturbations, and activation corruption. Trained multiple models, generated large-scale robustness datasets, and visualized performance degradation patterns.

* **Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China (May 2024 – July 2024)**  
  *Research Assistant – Blockchain-Based Framework for EV Charging Scheduling*  
  Designed, implemented, and evaluated blockchain-based EV charging scheduling algorithms. Collected and analyzed performance data from simulated deployments.

* **Bryn Mawr College (June 2023 – Current)**  
  *Independent Researcher – Debugging Visualization*  
  Developed the +Edges modification for eight fault-localization techniques. Conducted experiments on all 262 Defects4J Math faults and showed +Edges improves effectiveness significantly (e.g., Sørensen by 55.8%).
