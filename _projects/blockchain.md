Developed and evaluated a blockchain-based scheduling framework that assigns electric vehicles to charging stations using smart-contract coordination and geometric distance optimization.

Overview
======

This project explores how blockchain technology can support secure and decentralized scheduling for electric vehicle (EV) charging. We developed a smart-contract–driven framework that assigns vehicles to charging stations based on geometric distance calculations, providing an efficient and transparent way to manage large-scale spatial coordination. The system’s on-chain logic ensures tamper-resistant scheduling decisions, while off-chain components calculate proximity and system load information to guide station assignments.

To evaluate the framework, I ran simulations under diverse demand patterns and analyzed how the algorithm balances spatial efficiency, load distribution, and user travel cost. The results show that integrating geometric reasoning with blockchain execution can improve fairness and reduce congestion in multi-station scheduling scenarios. This work has been submitted as A Blockchain-Based Optimized and Secure Scheduling Framework for Charging Service (Lu, Wang, Chen, et al., 2024), documenting our system design and experimental findings.
